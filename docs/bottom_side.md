## Initial placement

Place elements on the bottom-side of the apparatus, as shown below. The board shown is the [MB8](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=MB8):
![Initial placement of items on the bottom-side of the board](bottom_side_initial.jpg).

Some comments:
- For the four legs, I recommend using at least 2 inch tall posts (e.g. [RS2P](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RS2P)).
- The WAV Trigger mount needs to be screwed on with "low-profile" (i.e. smaller head) #1/4"-20 screws, for example [92220A182](https://www.mcmaster.com/92220a182) from McMaster-Carr.
- The panel mounts also need low-profile screws, but longer lengths. For example: [92220A185](https://www.mcmaster.com/92220a185) from McMaster-Carr. (I recommend stocking multiple lengths.)

Next, mount the WAV Trigger board using #4-40 screws as follows. In the picture, I also mounted the three "4pin-bus" circuit boards on the Arduino:

## Place the 4pin-bus boards on the Arduino

Here are more detailed photographs showing the placement of the three "4pin-bus" circuit boards.

First "4pin-bus" board goes on pins 2, 3, 4, 5 of the Arduino:

The second "4pin-bus" board goes on pins 23, 25, 27, 29 of the Arduino:

The final "4pin-bus" board goes on 5V, GND, GND, Vin pins of the Arduino:

## Wire up the BNC panel

First, mount the populated BNC panel onto the board using #8-32 screws on the adapters:

## Wire up the WAV Trigger

## Wire up the encoder

## Wire up Saleae
