## Initial placement

Place elements on the bottom-side of the apparatus, as shown below:
![Initial placement of items on the bottom-side of the board](bottom_side_initial.jpg).

Some minor comments:
- For the four legs, I recommend using at least 2 inch tall posts.
- The WAV Trigger mount needs to be screwed on with "low-profile" (i.e. smaller head) screws.
