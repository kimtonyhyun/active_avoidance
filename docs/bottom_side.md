## Initial placement

Place elements on the bottom-side of the apparatus, as shown below. The board shown is the [MB8](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=MB8):

Some minor comments:
- For the four legs, I recommend using at least 2 inch tall posts (e.g. [RS2P](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RS2P)).
- The WAV Trigger mount needs to be screwed on with "low-profile" (i.e. smaller head) screws, for example [92220A182](https://www.mcmaster.com/92220a182) from McMaster-Carr.
