## Tap mounting adapters

Tap the Arduino and WAV Trigger mounts with #4-40 threads. Four locations per mount, as indicated with the yellow circle below:

Next, tap the side of the BNC panel mount with #8-32 thread. You'll need two pieces per setup:

## Assemble the encoder and wheel

Insert a #8-32 nut into the slot of the encoder mount. This allows you to connect the mount with a standard Thorlabs 1/2" diameter post:

Next, mount the HB5M encoder using four #4-40 screws:
